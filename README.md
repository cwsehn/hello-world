learning git hub...

The first thing I would like to find out is how this git-hub account is related to the setup I recently completed using git with the Command Line Interface.  On that account my username is slightly different than that of this git hub account, while the email address is the same for both.  I tried changing the username of this github account to match that of the CLI setup...but....apparently the change username submit I sent from the settings menu of this git-hub account didn't "take"...??? 

To be honest, I'm not 100% certain that having both accounts match is the optimal set-up at this point.  It just seems logical, again at the moment, that I would access a single account using either access point.....
